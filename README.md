SDL Fighting game

My attempt to learn SDL graphic engine and make a fighting game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. The ideea is to
be as close to real life fighting as possible. All interactions will be randomized, such as damage inflicted or punch and
kick styles. Also, in that respect there will be no jumping.
